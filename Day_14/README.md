Used a couple of inline table functions to make it more managable.<BR>
Initially tried to do with geometric types, but event the 1st solution took forever.<BR>
Switched to regualr SQL and the 1st solution went down to 1:40 minutes (still a lot).<BR>
The 2nd solution is still running, but I'm pretty sure it's solid. Will update if it isn't.
